# Changelog

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project uses semantic versioning. Versions before 0.9.0 are in the git history.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added
- Base payload ships the deferred-gate machinery: `omakase-record.sh` (a job records a
  per-commit result) and `deferred-check.sh` (the push gate that blocks unless a fresh
  passing record exists for the commit). Wired as a commented example in `lefthook-local.yml`
  and surfaced in `show`'s GUARDS chart + scorecard; covered end-to-end by
  `tests/deferred-gate.test.sh`. A fork inherits it instead of copying from another harness.

### Changed
- Gate model collapses to two terms: a **gate** (runs in the hook) and a **deferred gate**
  (checks a job ran for the commit). The earlier `live` / `deferred must-pass` /
  `deferred must-run` split and the `producer` term are retired — a deferred gate's
  block-on-failure vs proof-it-ran behavior is now the job's recording policy, not a gate
  type. Reconciled `concepts.md`, `authoring.md`, `README.md`, and the `add-gate` skill,
  which now interviews the user one question at a time to settle the shape.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added
- `add-gate` skill: an agent-facing walkthrough for wiring a tool, skill, or check to a git
  hook as a gate — picks the gate shape (live / deferred must-pass / deferred must-run),
  pre-flights whether a third-party tool can be gated at all, and shows the wiring (#24).

### Changed
- `show` renders one GUARDS chart with a "run when" column, replacing the separate
  per-hook listings (#23).
- Path classification recognizes Copilot lifecycle hooks (`.github/hooks/`), reusable
  prompt and persona assets (`.github/prompts/`, `.github/chatmodes/`), and Claude agents
  and hooks (`.claude/agents/`, `.claude/hooks/`); an invariant test asserts every known
  harness directory classifies to a concrete kind.

## [0.13.1] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- The harness self-heals on a bare `git worktree add`: a new linked worktree re-arms its
  injected files instead of running without them.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- `init` self-provisions lefthook: with no binary on PATH, `LEFTHOOK_BIN`, or
  `node_modules`, it fetches a pinned, checksum-verified binary into a per-machine cache
  instead of exiting (#17).
- Path classification recognizes GitHub Copilot CLI artifacts: `.github/skills/`,
  `.github/instructions/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `~/.copilot/` (#18).

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- Sources: install a harness from a git source repo with `init --source`, backed by a
  local cache, a manifest, a remembered source, and an orphan sweep on re-install (#16).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- `show` groups the installed inventory by origin: committed, injected, personal.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- Provenance ledger (`placed.tsv`): records the source and content hash of each placed
  file.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- v1 safety fixes and the v1 specification.
